		<h3>Clients and Servers</h3>
		<p>Computers connected to the <span>Web</span> are called <span>clients</span> and <span>servers</span>.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span>Clients</span> are the typical Web user's Internet-connected devices (for example, your computer connected to your Wi-Fi, of your phone connected to your mobil network) and <span>Web-accessing software</span> available on those devices (usally a web browser like Firefox or Chrome).</li>
			<li><span>Servers</span> are computers that store <span>webpages</span>, <span>sites</span>, <span>apps</span>. When a client device wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the user's web browser.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>So What Actually Happens?</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The borwser goes to the <span>DNS server</span> and finds the reall address of the <span>server</span> that the wevsite lives on.</li>
			<li>The browser sends an <span>HTTP request</span> message to the server asking it to send a copy of the website to the client.</li>
			<li>If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a <span>"200 OK" message</span>, which means "Permission granted! Here you go!", and then starts sending the website's files to the browser as a series of small chuncks.</li>
			<li>The browser assembles the small chuncks into a complete website and displays it to you!</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>The Big 3 - HTML, CSS, JavaScript</h3>
		<p>While the server can process information in many different languages, the files that they serve to the client are <span>always</span> going to be some combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!</p>
